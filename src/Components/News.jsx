      title: 'Official - Alon Turgeman Joins Hapoel Beer Sheva',
      image: 'src/pictures/news-img2.jpg',
      content: 'Hapoel Beer Sheva has a new attacker. The Reds announced today (Tuesday) on the addition of Alon Turgeman, who agreed with the club for two years and will sign subject to medical tests. The striker will be the first player of Eliniv Barda this summer and one who can upgrade his front part. Turgeman, who finished his contract with Hapoel Haifa and became a free agent, expressed a great desire to join Hapoel B.S. and was willing to do so even for a lower salary than what he earned in Carmel. The B.S. professional team believes that the striker will be able to contribute to the upgrade of the wing, a position that was less prominent in the team in the past season.',

  title: 'A Star In The Making: Europe is putting its eye on Dor Turgeman after another great perfomance. Maccabi Tel Aviv know how hard itll be to keep him this summer.',
  image: 'src/pictures/news-img3.jpg',
  content: 'In light of his wonderful ability in the Mondialeto, Maccabi Tel Aviv understands that it will be difficult to keep Dor Turgeman in the team. The striker experienced a great tournament, including a star perfomance in the victory over Brazil with a goal after a brilliant individual play. In addition to the offers that already exist, among others from Benfica Lisbon, he arouses interest in all of Europe, and it is estimated that Maccabi Tel Aviv will receive additional official offers soon. Despite the players contract for another season with the Yellows and despite Maccabi Tel Aviv offering him a long-term contract, Turgeman would prefer to go to Europe. It is already clear that in any case Maccabi Tel Aviv is building on the player and he should be integrated in a much more massive way than he was this year, but the big question will of course be whether it will be possible to keep him. In any case, a very interesting summer is expected for the youngster.'

    content: 'The success of the youth team is sweeping Israel and it is very possible that Ilay Mademon will benefit a lot from it. The 20-year-old midfielder will begin training for the 2023/24 season with Hapoel Beer Sheva and will go with the team to the training camp, after which it will be decided on the continuation of his career. If he impresses in the training camp, Madamon may remain in the Hapoel BS squad this season with the idea of â€‹giving him significant playing minutes. Another option is to loan him for a third season in a row after he already wore the uniform of Bnei Yehuda and last season was a small part of Beitar Jerusalems victory in the state cup.',
